# Custom Sort

Custom Sort is a Python program that allows you to sort files in a separate folder based on their file extensions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the `custom-sort.py` file is located.
2. Run the program by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    python custom-sort.py
    ```

3. Enter the extension of the files that you want to sort.
4. The program will then scan the specified directory, sort the files based on their extensions, and move them to the specified destination directory.

For example, if the file extension is `.txt`, the file will be moved to the `custom-sort(.txt)` directory.
